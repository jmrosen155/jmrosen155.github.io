I am currently pursuing a MS degree in Data Science at Columbia University (graduation expected December 2015). In particular, I am taking courses in algorithms, probability, statistical inference, machine learning, distributed computer systems, modeling social data, and visualization. I am experienced working with tools such as Python, R, SQL, Hadoop, and d3.js. I am interested in learning more about data science or analytics opportunities so that I can apply my knowledge in an inventive environment.

Please check out my project work for more information on the types of work I have done. 

Feel free to contact me to discuss my background, potential networking opportunities, or just to chat about data science. My resume is available upon request.

I am currently a Senior Data Scientist at iHeartRadio Digital. I focus on building data products and models to support personalization, enhance user experience, and drive engagement. My goal is to deliver the most relevant content to the right customers at the right time. I am passionate about extracting meaning from massive amounts of structured and unstructured information and building tools to improve the way we interact with data everyday.

I completed my MS degree in Data Science at Columbia University in December of 2015. In particular, I took courses in algorithms, probability, statistical inference, machine learning, distributed computer systems, and visualization. I am experienced working with tools such as Python, Spark, Hive, SQL, Unix, R, Hadoop, and d3.js.

Please check out my project work for more information on the types of work I have done. 

Feel free to contact me to discuss my background, potential networking opportunities, or just to chat about data science. My resume is available upon request.

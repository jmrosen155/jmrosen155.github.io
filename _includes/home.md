I am currently pursuing a MS degree in Data Science at Columbia University. In particular, I am taking courses in algorithms, statistical inference, machine learning, distributed computer systems, and visualization. I am interested in learning more about data science or analytics opportunities so that I can apply my knowledge in an inventive environment. My resume is available upon request.

Please check out my project work for more information on the types of work I have done. 

Feel free to contact me to discuss my background, potential networking opportunities, or just to chat about data science.

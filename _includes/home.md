I am currently a Customer Data Scientist at American Express. I focus on building data products and models to bring the best marketing offers to the right customers at the right time to support offer personalization and enhance customer experience. I am passionate about extracting meaning from massive amounts of structured and unstructured information and building tools to improve the way we interact with data everyday.

I completed my MS degree in Data Science at Columbia University in December of 2015. In particular, I took courses in algorithms, probability, statistical inference, machine learning, distributed computer systems, and visualization. I am experienced working with tools such as Python, Spark, Hive, SQL, Unix, R, Hadoop, and d3.js.

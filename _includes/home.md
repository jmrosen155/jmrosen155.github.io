I am currently a Customer Data Scientist at American Express. I focus on building data products and models to support offer personalization, enhance customer experience, and drive engagement. Basically, I help to ensure we are bringing the best marketing offers to the right customers at the right time. I am passionate about extracting meaning from massive amounts of structured and unstructured information and building tools to improve the way we interact with data everyday.

I completed my MS degree in Data Science at Columbia University in December of 2015. In particular, I took courses in algorithms, probability, statistical inference, machine learning, distributed computer systems, and visualization. I am experienced working with tools such as Python, Spark, Hive, SQL, Unix, R, Hadoop, and d3.js.

Please check out my project work for more information on the types of work I have done. 

Feel free to contact me to discuss my background, potential networking opportunities, or just to chat about data science. My resume is available upon request.
